goal: script to make kingfisher move
objective: figure out the commands
status: success
report:

* Make sure you call catkin_make and source devel/setup.bash*
if you don't, you will get a lot of issues!


If I want to launch the kingfisher robot in gaezbo, this works: $ roslaunch kingfisher_gazebo kingfisher_gazebo_worlds.launch


To move in the command-line, I can use: rostopic pub /cmd_drive usv_gazebo_plugins/UsvDrive -r 10 "left: 1.0 right: 0.0"
